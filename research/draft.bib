The climate is changing at a drastic rate nowadays, which makes the old weather prediction methods less effective and more hectic. To overcome these difficulties, the improved and reliable weather prediction methods are required. These predictions affect a nation's economy and the lives of people. To develop a weather forecasting system that can be used in remote areas is the main motivation of this work. The data analytics and machine learning algorithms, such as random forest classification, are used to predict weather conditions. In this paper, a low-cost and portable solution for weather prediction is devised.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICSC45622.2019.8938211},  ISSN={2643-444X},  month={March},}

With the usage of in this project, the sample dataset was used to test data mining approaches for weather forecasting utilizing the Time series algorithm with SARIMAX. Big data analysis entails analyzing a large data set. It is made up of several forms of data. Big data stores a lot of information. that data is processed Traditional data analysis can only deal with structured data, whereas modern data analysis can deal with both structured and unstructured data. data that isn't structured Both organized and unstructured data may be processed using big data. Machine learning uses a variety of datasets in many dimensions with the potential to predict outcomes.to be used on software that organizes, gathers, and analyses data in general accurately.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICCMC53470.2022.9754024},  ISSN={},  month={March},}

	abstract={Weather forecasting is both a high impact application as well as a complex Big Data modelling challenge. Recent advances in machine learning have already demonstrated the power of non-physical modelling approaches for the prediction of rainfall. The Weather4cast competitions now provide a unique multi-channel benchmark for the prediction of up to 8 hours of weather with high temporal and spatial resolutions (15 min, 4 km) for a diverse set of large regions across Earth. This diversity, for the first time, also permits a meaningful spatial transfer learning challenge in weather forecasting.Weather4cast introduces multi-channel weather ‘movies’ that encode temperature, rainfall, cloud properties, and turbulence as derived from the meteorological satellites by the EUMETSAT NWC SAF. Inspired by the Traffic4cast competitions at the NeurIPS conferences in 2019 and 2020, weather forecasting is thus presented as a video frame prediction task. As then, the U-Net based models developed for photographic image analysis intriguingly did well on these artificial videos. In contrast, however, the winning submission did not employ a U-Net but a recurrent convolutional network with residual units.Weather4cast introduces the first spatial transfer learning challenge in weather forecasting: only one-hour short snippets from spatial regions never seen before were provided as input to models. We can thus now present first insights from submissions to this spatial transfer learning challenge. Notably, models with better core prediction performance also generalized better. Moreover, the two top-ranked models – one RCN based, one U-Net based – were further ahead of the remaining top-ranked submissions for spatial transfer learning (+6%) than in the core prediction challenge (+1%).While submissions tested varying strategies for input data selection and training, there remains a wide range of additional complementary approaches to be explored in future analyses. The competition and its leaderboards remain available and open for new submissions on the weather4cast.ai website.},

	abstract={In recent years, big data and Internet of Things (IoT) implementations started getting more attention. Researchers focused on developing big data analytics solutions using machine learning models. Machine learning is a rising trend in this field due to its ability to extract hidden features and patterns even in highly complex datasets. In this study, we used our Big Data IoT Framework in a weather data analysis use case. We implemented weather clustering and sensor anomaly detection using a publicly available dataset. We provided the implementation details of each framework layer (acquisition, ETL, data processing, learning and decision) for this particular use case. Our chosen learning model within the library is Scikit-Learn based k-means clustering. The data analysis results indicate that it is possible to extract meaningful information from a relatively complex dataset using our framework.},

	abstract={From ancient days machines do obey the commands that are prepared by a human or a user, according to the program the machine does operate in its style, and this way of controlling a machine is said as Machine learning. Not only in the development of IT companies but also the rise of education system it takes a major part. Normally a human can able to store his memories. Using such kinds of stored memories he is learning new things which makes him feel better than before. Machines are quite different from human knowledge, instead of using memory power, it uses statistical comparison to analyze data. Here the number of data is stored in a database and according to the reaction received from the user, it gets additional data to create new data. For example let us have a music application, once a person hears music using the application then for this further entry he will get repeated music which he/she heard before. In this case, the application is working based on the machine learning algorithm, at first, it collects the information from the user then it uses the same information (data) to make efficient of the user's work when he returns. This paper approaches the necessity and development made in higher education system using Machine learning algorithm, most commonly the author have involved the concepts and algorithm based on Support Vector Machines and Learning Management systems. The prediction model is the most important thing which is created by the machine, while seeing about the statistical model with music the tempo and medium tempo is received as data from the user. Based on this concept the author has compared it with the educational system with a large amount of data consumption and that is similar to Deep learning.},

	abstract={The whole world is plagued by the dynamical clement and their facet, to cut back this facet effects up to some extent there are several techniques and algorithms through which we will predict the weather on the ready reference along with respective context of given information from past years example temperature, dew, humidity air pressure and wind direction,. When doing the analysis of existing data from past few years we inculcated the proposed scheme or techniques which have a tendency to conclude that, machine learning paradigm and permits us to research the given set of knowledge and extract the helpful information from the given dataset, thus so as to grasp the unsteady patterns of climatic conditions, a prognosticative model is also persuaded. During this paper or scheme, we have a tendency to explore progressive statistical linear regression and support vector machine techniques of machine learning that teams' constant kind information sets along and to prefigure the forecast or weather prediction. Under the proposed scheme we have a tendency to inculcate the augmented algorithmic rule that provides approximate and nearby results to forecast the climate for the next 5 days and at the end results are calculated on the idea of mathematical and statistical decision tree and conditions vide confusion matrix for more appropriate and accurate forecasting using Big Data.},
